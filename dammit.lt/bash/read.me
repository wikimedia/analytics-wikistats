Read 'cellar' as 'no longer used, archived'

Use dammit_compact_copy_to_hdfs.sh to make a backup copy of compacted pagecounts files to hdfs, after which they can be deleted from wikistats_data/dammit/pagecounts/merged (first check if copy was succesful, via file files_in_hdfs) 
These files are also in public folder https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagecounts-ez/merged/
Please treat these files as of long term significance, future data archeologists will thank you for that!
This long term data preservation project was initiated by community members, and WMF took over later. Compare to Twitter archive maintained by US Library of Congress, a treasure trove for data-aware historians to build a ZeitGeist.
